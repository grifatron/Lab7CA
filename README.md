# Lab7CA

This lab aimed to have us learn how to build a program counter and how its important to the datapath of a processor. On startup, this program begins counting and reading off each instruction in the ROM until reset is set high and back to low after at least one clock cycle, where the program counter begins at the start again. The only inputs for this program are the clock and reset. The outputs include rs1, rs2, rd and imm, which go with the register file and the rest of the datapath.
